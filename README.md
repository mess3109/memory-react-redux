# Memory Game with Classic Art
This is the classic memory card game built with React and Redux on the frontend and Express and Prisma on the backend.  The images on the cards come from the [Artsy API](https://developers.artsy.net).  [Here](https://memory-react-redux-artsy.herokuapp.com/) is a demo on Heroku.
